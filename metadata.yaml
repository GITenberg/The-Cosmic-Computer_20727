description: Conn Maxwell returns from Terra to his home world of Poictesme, dubbed
  "The Junkyard Planet" because of all the military equipment left behind after the
  last war.  Conn claims he has found the location of Merlin, a military super-computer
  rumored to have been left behind.  But is Merlin real, or just a myth?  And will
  Conn's knowledge of the computer save Poictesme -- or tear his world apart?
